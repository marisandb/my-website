				<h1>The Shelby Butterfly Trails</h1>
                <h2>3701 Old Vineyard Rd, La Crosse, WI 54601</h2>
                <div class="blog-article">
                    <p>One of my favorite trails to hike is hidden away in La Crosse on the side of the bluffs. A short drive up a steep incline leads to a small parking lot with two entries. </p>

                    <p>It’s a short hike with beautiful views. The beginning of the hike starts with a rocky incline. There is quite the abundance of insects - especially Harvestman, more commonly called daddy longlegs that you can see crossing the rocky path with you. Not to worry, as someone with a healthy fear of spiders, they keep their distance. Despite my fear I respect that I am in their territory and appreciate their place in the ecosystem. </p>

                    <p>Once you reach the plateau of the incline you will find the path splits in two opposing directions. I recommend going left as that is where you will get to see the beautiful flower patch. There is also a fairly cool car that sits decaying this way if that’s more your style. </p>

                    <p>As you continue to walk you will stumble across a sign that details a Boy Scouts Troop project to create a restoration site for Monarch Butterflies. These butterflies are suffering from habitat loss and this project hopes to provide a space for them to thrive. It asks hikers to please stay on the marked trail so as to not disturb the many insects who enjoy the wildflowers. </p>

                    <p>As you walk through the wildflowers, especially during peak bloom times, you can enjoy the sight of both bees and butterflies flying from flower to flower. Enjoy the sights along with the sounds of various birds singing their songs. This is my favorite part of the hike and my daughter and I often spend a long time strolling through admiring the wildlife. </p>

                    <p>The second portion of the hike involves the bluff. This provides incredible views of the city of La Crosse. My favorite part is when the eagles and hawks make their rounds flying just above your head. I have many videos of hawks just a few feet away from myself as they perch in the trees. I will also mention this part of the hike can be a bit tricky as the trail gets narrow and moves downhill. </p>
                    <img src="../images/overlook.jfif" alt="Marisa smiling in a white jacket" width="400px">
                    <p>The final portion of the hike takes you through a rocky downhill stroll through the trees. It’s quiet and cool which is especially nice on hot summer days. I’ve seen a number of deer cross my path on this last leg of the trail. My favorite being a fawn who I accidentally spooked from their laying spot.</p>
                    <img src="../images/downhill.jfif" alt="Marisa smiling in a white jacket" width="400px">
                    <p> Once I finally make my way back to my car, I can’t help but feel like I’d rather be on the trail again taking in the sights. Overall, this trail brings me a sense of calmness and closeness to nature that you simply have to experience for yourself. Lace up your hiking boots and check it out yourself. I rarely run into other hikers on this trail and enjoy the sense that this is my secret happy place. I hope you are able to find similar happiness on this trail if you choose to explore it. Happy hiking! </p>
